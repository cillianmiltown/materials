#### **What is the purpose of the study?**
This study aims to investigate the process by which people make moral judgements.

#### **Why have I been invited to participate in this study?**
For the study to be conducted a number of people over the age of 18 are needed who are willing to participate. There is no other specific criterion for participation.

#### **What does participation involve?**
Your participation is entirely voluntary. If you initially decide to take part you can subsequently change your mind and withdraw from the study at any time and without the need to give any reason or justify your decision.

If you agree to participate you will be asked a series of questions relating to moral judgements.
You will be presented with a moral scenario and you will be asked to rate the behaviour of the characters described in the scenarios. You will then be asked a number of other questions relating to details in the scenario.

The entire study should be finished within ten to fifteen minutes.

#### **What if I change my mind about participating?**
Participation is voluntary so you do not have to take part in the study if you do not want to; there is no penalty for not participating. If you decide to take part and then change your mind you can withdraw from the study at any point without giving a reason and there will be no consequences.

#### **Are there benefits from my participation?**
Studies like these can make an important contribution to our understanding of the factors affecting how people make decisions relating to moral issues. As such, the findings from this study may be presented at national and international conferences and may be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. However, no individual participant will be identified in any publication or presentation. Individuals will not be offered any monetary or other rewards for their participation.

#### **Are there any risks involved in participating?**

This study is investigating the factors influencing the making of moral judgements. The scenarios you will be presented with may cause offence or distress.  You are reminded that participation is voluntary and you may withdraw at any time.

#### **What will happen to the data I provide for the study?**
Electronic data will be stored in a password protected database and will be held for a period of 7 years. Anonymised data will be stored indefinitely and may be made available to other researchers in the field through the Open Science Framework.  The Open Science Framework (OSF) is an open source software project that facilitates open collaboration in science research.  Researchers can upload data, analysis and other research materials, making them publicly available for use by other researchers in the field.  The research will act in accordance to the data protection act.

#### **Who can I contact if I have any questions or want to find out more about the study?**
